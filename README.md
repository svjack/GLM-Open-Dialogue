  <p align="center">
   		A enhanced Open Dialogue Context Generator supported by General Language Model Pretraining with Autoregressive Blank Infilling
    <br />
  </p>
</p>

## Brief introduction
Given the definition of Open-Domain Dialogue Generation [Open-domain Dialogue Generation:
What We Can Do, Cannot Do, And Should Do Next](https://aclanthology.org/2022.nlp4convai-1.13.pdf)
```
Given zero or more previous dialogue turns between
itself and one or more other participants,
a system  output a fluent, engaging,
and meaningful natural language response.
```
A well known model deal with this task is [DialoGPT](https://github.com/microsoft/DialoGPT),
You can try [DialoGPT](https://github.com/microsoft/DialoGPT) on [Roxza DialoGPT space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Roxza/DialoGPT)

Following is a English example compare the output of DialoGPT and GLM(this project do)

### English Examples

|Model |First Question | Response chain |
|---------|--------|-------|
|DialoGPT |Does money buy happiness? | Depends how much money you spend on it.|
|||  What is the best way to buy happiness ?|
|||  You just have to be a millionaire by your early 20s, then you can be happy .|
||| This is so difficult !|
|||You have no idea how hard it is to be a millionaire and happy . There is a reason the rich have a lot of money|
|GLM |Does money buy happiness? | Can money buy happiness?|
|||Yes, what about you?That is happiness.|
|||Oh yeah!|
|||You will be happy.|
|||Oh, I got it.How are you happy?|
|||I think no.|
|||Everyone has different definitions of happiness, and money cannot buy happiness.|
|DialoGPT |what is the meaning of life ? | The  meaning  is  to  be  with  your  family  and friends .|
|||I’m going to guess :  It means that your parents and friends have loved you . That’s the meaning , I believe .|
|||I think  the  meaning  is  to  make  sure  you’re alive when you die . So you’ll be with your family , friends , and yourself .|
|||It’s not , but thanks for trying to help .|
GLM |what is the meaning of life ? | You just like life, answer? |
|||of course is.|
|||Who said life itself?|
|||Does life have no meaning?|
|||Yes is.|
|||What do you like to do with me that is meaningful?|
|||Enjoy every moment of your life and feel meaningful.|

## HuggingFace Space demonstration
* 1 Multilanguage demonstration: https://huggingface.co/spaces/svjack/GLM-Open-Dialogue
* 2 Chinese demonstration: https://huggingface.co/spaces/svjack/GLM-Open-Dialogue-Chinese

## Installation and Instructions
```bash
pip install -r req0.txt
pip install -r req1.txt
```
### Instructions
I recommand run the demo on a computer with gpu:
If you have gpu: change the first line of [predict_t5_choose_simple.py](predict_t5_choose_simple.py) from
```python
device = "cpu"
```
to
```python
device = "cuda:0"
```
Then
```python
from main import *

#### English Usage
##### max_times set to 10 will take more times than 2, and more outputs 
demo_func(*["Which keyboard do you prefer?", "en", 2])
demo_func(*["Which keyboard do you prefer?", "en", 10])
#### Japanese Usage
demo_func(*["東京と京都のどちらが住みやすいですか。", "ja", 2])
demo_func(*["東京と京都のどちらが住みやすいですか。", "ja", 10])

#### Chinese Usage
demo_func(*["程序员要掌握哪些技能", "zh", 5])
### OR
generate_func(*["程序员要掌握哪些技能", 5])

generate_func(*["你对《三国演义》感兴趣吗?", 10])
generate_func(*["谁能让美国再一次伟大?", 10])
```

## Construction
### Migrate GLM to Open-Domain Dialogue Generation domain
Many this kinds models focus train a generate model on some specific datasets, This may constraints from datasets and pretrained models, When faced with a open domain with a broad breadth of knowledge, the generator may has more risk of cause Blandness Problem by bland answers or give some response lack of vividness. </br>
This project deal with this kinds of problems by a unsupervised combination method. And decompose this problem to four steps:
* 1 Self-train a Open-Domain Dialogue generator on a small dataset from scratch and use it as a <b>"Construct Generator"</b>
* 2 Use [FlagAI](https://github.com/FlagAI-Open/FlagAI)'s [GLM](https://github.com/FlagAI-Open/FlagAI/blob/master/examples/glm_blank_filling/glm_generate_samples.py) as <b>"Knowledge Generator"</b>
* 3 Use a self-trained <b>"Context Discriminer"</b> to combine above two generators. <br/>
* 4 Use a self-trained <b>"Context Reconstructor"</b> to reconstruct the context. <br/>

There is no high requirement for the accuracy of the "Construct Generator".<br/>

The above four models are released in [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co), list in the below sheet.

|Knowledge Generator| https://huggingface.co/BAAI/glm-large-chinese | https://huggingface.co/BAAI |
|Context Discriminer| https://huggingface.co/svjack/T5-dialogue-choose | https://huggingface.co/svjack |
|Context Reconstructor| https://huggingface.co/svjack/T5-dialogue-collect | https://huggingface.co/svjack |

They all build above Chinese, and use [facebook m2m_100_1.2B](https://huggingface.co/facebook/m2m100_1.2B) translator make them support Multilanguage domain.

### Prompt --- basic concept throughout the project
There are four entry points <b>Prompt</b> make for this project.

|Task Oriented Prompt Format for choose best|[Context Discriminer](https://huggingface.co/svjack/T5-dialogue-choose)|[Bigscience-mt0](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/mt0-large)|According to the following context, choose the optimal follow-up sentence Context: {}\n{}Answer:|根据如下上下文，选择最优的后续句子 上下文：{}\n{}答案：|
|Task Oriented Prompt Format for reconstruct context|[Context Reconstructor](https://huggingface.co/svjack/T5-dialogue-collect)|[Bigscience-mt0](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/mt0-large)|According to the following context, reconstruct the Context: {}\n{}Answer:|根据下面的上下文进行分段： 上下文：{} 答案：|

## Examples

|Language |First Question | Response chain |
|---------|--------|-------|
|English |Which keyboard do you like? | My true love!|
|||My favorite mechanical keyboard!|
|||The mechanics.keyboard|
|||HP Mechanical Keyboard|
|||Of course a mechanical keyboard.|
|||I like the mechanical keyboard, though not the hippie mouse.|
|||I like it, but listen.Do you want?|
|||HP's mechanical keyboard is really useful, and the cost is very high, but|
|Japanese |東京と京都はどちらがいいですか?|はい。,..わからないけど、あなたはどうですか?|
|||京都!|
|||うん、確信がない。,..あなたはどうですか?|
|||京都に行くと東京は観光都市です。|
|||誰もが京都よりはマシだと思っている。また、日本の都市|
|||個人的には京都の方がお得だと思います。|
|||知っている。あなたはエッフェル塔の頂上に行ったことがありますか?|
|Chinese |你对《三国演义》感兴趣吗?|是的,我喜欢各种人物。你觉得怎么样?|
|||我觉得可以,因为太无聊了。我喜欢《三国演义》,但是没时间去看。|
|||抖机灵,我喜欢历史,《三国志》。这些经典读起来不枯燥,有很强的吸引力,很适合初学者。|
|||哦,我也喜欢历史。你有兴趣吗?|
|||看历史,我感兴趣。|
|||毕竟,《三国志》是经典,但是要看清人物才能更好地理解人物性格。|
